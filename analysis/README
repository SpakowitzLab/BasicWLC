this folder contains parser/helper files for wlcsim analysis

it was written for the use of the risca lab, but anyone else is free to use/edit it!

main code is MCsim which is a wlcsim output parser with some analysis methods, such as:
    * visualize trajectory in pymol
    * end-to-end distance
    * pairwise nucleosome distances
    * interpolate basepair resolution DNA structure between coarse-graied wlcsim beads
    * determine ricc-seq break patterns from interpolated fiber structure
    
some minimal helper functions also exist in utility, such as:
    * apply rotation/translation of linker DNA into and out of nucleosome
    * parametrize DNA as two offset helices to build a phosphate-base-phosphate representation of B-DNA
