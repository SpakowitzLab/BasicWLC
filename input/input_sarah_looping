# Comment lines must start with a ``#''.
#
# All other lines must be of the form
# "paramName paramValue"
# where paramValue is parsed directly into its target
# datatype by Fortran, and so care must be taken to match
# the expected input format for the relevant type. e.g. 5/2
# will not work for 2.5. e.g. 3.0 will error if an int is
# expected.
